        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
        I am a full stack developer having 3 years of experience. I was born and brought up in India and I love this country. From the school time, I was good at maths, and it was my first love as well. I further pursued my interest in maths by learning coding and getting admission in a good college. I completed my bachelors in 2020. In college time, I organized and attended workshops in coding background, participated in programming competitions and tried in competitive programming as well. I got a offer from google to be part of DSC in college, but later my college got ruled out. After that I got placed in a great company which I am currently working with too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started learning C language back in my first year in college, In my 2nd year, I started learning Android, and made some good projects for myself and for college as well. In my 3rd year, I did a internship with a startup company and developed an android app which can replace alexa and it is offline too. In my last year I worked with java spring in same company i got placed in as part of my internship. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After getting a job, I started working with frontend and within 3 months of learning,I developed a chatroom from React and Redux which used firebase. I really enjoyed working with React.js and decided to continue working in this field. For now, I have developed some personal as well as some client projects and learned many new things. I have almost 1 year of experience working in this field and will continue working in this field in future.
